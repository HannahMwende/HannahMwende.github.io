## 📖 About Me

> *". My journey isn’t just about analyzing data – it’s about transforming it into insights,  solutions, and telling the story the data is longing to tell. With a strong foundation in data analytics, visualization, and cloud technologies, I specialize in building intuitive dashboards, automating data workflows, and uncovering patterns that shape business strategy. I take pride not only in delivering technically sound solutions but also in collaborating closely with teams to ensure every insight is relevant, meaningful, and aligned with real-world needs. For me, data is more than numbers, it’s a powerful tool for understanding people, solving problems, and creating lasting impact."*
